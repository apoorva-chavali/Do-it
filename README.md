# Do-it
1. Initially a discord bot has been created through the Discord Developers portal
2. Copy the token and store it safely.
3. Add the token in the place of 'insert your token here' in the code.

This bot is a basic timer bot. It randomly generates a timetable for you. The basic commands of this bot are
1. !hello or !hi -> Introductory message
2. !generate_tt -> Geneartes a personalised time table. Example ->!generate_tt math-120 physics-120 
3. !stop_timer -> Stops the timer and bot goes back to sleep
4. !bye -> Bot will still be online but sends a bye message    

This bot can be further optimised and more commands can be added accordingly.
